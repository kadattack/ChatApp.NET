https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtQiiknWUcI


The only thing taken from the Django tutorial above, is the HTML and CSS. The rest was made from scratch.


The app includes live chat implemented with SignalR.
Account management is implemented with IdentityUser and roles are implemented with IndentityRole.

## TODO
- [ ] Implement role management. Roles exist, however there are no checks yet for what each role can do.
- [ ] Add string length checks. Currently there is no length limit input on all forms.
- [ ] Add identication of online presence. People can currently see in the console log if someone comes online.


## Release
This procjet is only used for portoflio.
